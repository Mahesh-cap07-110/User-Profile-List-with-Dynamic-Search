Search Functionality

1. At the top of the application, there's an input field where users can enter the name of the profile they want to search for.

2. As the user types in the search field, the list of displayed profiles dynamically updates to only show profiles matching the search query.

3. The search is case-insensitive, so users can enter search terms in any case.

4. If no matching profiles are found, a message "No matching profiles found." is displayed.
